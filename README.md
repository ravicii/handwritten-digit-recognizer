# Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer
A simple CNN model that recognizes handwritten digits .
Trained on mnist dataset.

# How to Use it:
Check the model architecture in the create_model.py file .
I have already included a pre-trained model so no need to create the model again.
Run predict.py to use the model to give prediction.
I use contour to detect where the digits are and then pre-process it to feed it into the cnn to get the prediction.

# Following Packages are Used:
Tensorflow,CV2, and Numpy
