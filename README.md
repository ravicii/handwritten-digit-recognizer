# handwritten-digit-recognizer
A simple CNN model that recognizes handwritten digits 
trained on mnist dataset
# How to use
check the model architecture in the create_model.py file 
i have alreday included a pre-trained model so no need to create the model again
run predict.py to use the model to give prediction
i use contour to detect where the digits are and then pre-process it to feed it into the cnn to get the prediction
